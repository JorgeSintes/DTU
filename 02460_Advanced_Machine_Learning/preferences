1. Reinforcement learning with Reward Machines - Tue Herlau
    It's the one that appeals the most to me. We don't need prior experience with deep learning/Neural Networks.
    We have plenty of time to work on the project.

2. Detection of outliers, errors - Bald guy whose name I don't remember.
    It was the one presented right before the reinforcement learning one. Pretty cool too: don't need prior experience.

3 - 4. Explainability in deep learning - Both the LIME project and the more open one. Lars whatever.
    The open one: the supervisor looks cooler, but it's very open and we could screw it up
    The LIME one: the supervisor seems an asshole but it could be interesting aswell. Plus, probably a good grade.
